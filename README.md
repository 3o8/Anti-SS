# Disguiser 
**A fun project to learn Golang better.**\
This tool discuises itself as an "Optimizer" for the user's pc.\
When the user writes the "secret" code the application writes and runs an executable file from a .log file. It can be a virus, it can be a cheating executable for a game or it can just be a normal executable.\
It then deletes every trace of the application. Containing changed registry keys, temp files etc.
